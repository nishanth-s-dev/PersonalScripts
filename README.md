## Overview

This repository serves as a personal toolbox where I store Python scripts that automate everyday tasks. These scripts help reduce manual, repetitive actions, and optimize common development workflows.

## How to Use

To use any of the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PersonalScripts.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```
    cd PersonalProjects
    ```
3. Run the main.py file:
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
4. The script will present you with a list of available functions. Select the desired option, and based on your choice, the program will prompt you for any additional inputs required (such as a file path, folder name, etc.). Follow the instructions on the command line to execute the chosen function.

## Scripts

### 1. `say_hello`

- **Purpose:** A simple function that prints a greeting message to the console.
- **Usage:** Run this function to display a message saying "Hello ðŸ˜Ž".
  
### 2. `move_items_to_parent_and_cleanup`

- **Purpose:** Moves items from subfolders to their parent folder and deletes the empty subfolders afterward.
- **Usage:** Provide the path to the root folder, and the script will move the contents from each subfolder into its parent folder.
- **Example**:
   - If your root folder contains subfolders like this:
     ```
     root_folder/
     â”œâ”€â”€ parent_folder1/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder1/
     â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file1.txt
     â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file2.txt
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder2/
     â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file3.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ parent_folder2/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder3/
     â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file4.txt
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder4/
     â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file5.txt
     ```
   - After running the script, the folder will be flattened like this:
     ```
     root_folder/
     â”œâ”€â”€ parent_folder1/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file1.txt
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file2.txt
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file3.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ parent_folder2/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file4.txt
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file5.txt
     ```
